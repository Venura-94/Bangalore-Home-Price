## 1. Overview:
• Objective: Create a prediction model to project real estate values according to different aspects of the property.
• Business Context: Accurate value predictions help investors, real estate developers, and interested parties make informed decisions.
## 2. Project Overview:
• Scope: The project's main goal is to predict and understand house values through the use of machine learning, particularly Linear Regression.
• Data Source: Make use of historical real estate data that includes services, location, size, and market trends, among other features.
• Technologies: Use Python for analysis, model training (with sci-kit-learn), and data preprocessing steps.
## 3. Key Objectives following up with ML Pipeline
1.Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gathering and organizing data on property features and prices.
2.Feature Engineering: Unveiling insights by creating meaningful features.
3.Model Selection: Opting for Linear Regression to unravel relationships between variables.
4.Training & Evaluation: Fitting the model, assessing performance with MAE, MSE, and R².
5.Feature Importance: Identifying key factors impacting house prices.
## 4. Business Benefits
• Help Prospective Homebuyers Make Informed Decisions: Provide them with a tool to gauge property values according to their priorities and preferences.
• Risk Mitigation for Developers: By comprehending market trends and elements influencing property values, one can assist real estate developers in devising pricing strategies.
• Investment Planning: By projecting possible returns on real estate investments, can help investors make data-driven decisions.
• Market Insight: Offer a more thorough comprehension of real estate dynamics, assisting in the development of well-informed company plans and market data.
## 5. Future Enhancements:
• Look at other regression methods for comparison.
• To improve feature richness, integrate external data sources.
• Create a scalable system for ongoing model refinement and real-time prediction.
